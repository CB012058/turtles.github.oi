                        <h1>Kosgoda turtle hatchery</h1>
                        <p> 
                            Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. 
                            They start with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, bringing their eggs to the secure environment of the hatchery and finally releasing the baby turtles into the sea on the day of their birth. 
                            However, if there are complications, they tend to them and release them only once they’re fit to go into the vast ocean.
                            </p>
                            <h2>History  of the kosgoda turtle hatchery</h2>
                            <p>In 1981 a turtle hatchery was established to protect the eggs of sea turtles that lay their eggs on the nearby beaches.
                                 The hatchery collects the eggs and incubates them in a controlled environment, before releasing the hatchlings back into the ocean once they are ready.
                                  The hatchery is run by the Wild Life and Nature Protection Society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Kosgoda has a long history of Buddhist worship, and it is home to a number of ancient temples and religious sites. The most notable of these is the Kosgoda Raja Maha Viharaya, a Buddhist temple that dates back to the 16th century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In recent years, Kosgoda has become a popular destination for eco-tourism. In addition to its turtle hatchery, the town also offers opportunities for bird watching, canoeing, and other outdoor activities.

                    <p>The bentota turtle hatchery protects the eggs until they hatch and are ready to swim back home.
                        The project also rescues turtles that are injured while at sea, due  to fishing net , motor and more .
                        They are often rehabilitad before being released back.</p>
                        
                         <h2>What you can experience</h2>
                        <p>At sunset, you can witness the baby turtles being set free on the beach and watch them make their way back to the ocean.
                             Visitors are asked to be mindful of the process of returning baby turtles to the sea. 
                             Loud noises are not allowed, nor are bright lights and flash photography; the baby turtles can confuse the lights for the moon over the ocean, which hinders them from being able to return home.</p>
