            <p> Turtles are a successful group of animals that have witnessed the rise and fall of the dinosaurs.<br>
                 They have inhabited the earth for over 100 million years and survived in great numbers until recent past.<br>
                              They have evolved from large,lnad living tortoise-like animals.</p>

                    <h3>Nesting behaviour</h3>
                    <p>Adult male turtles have well developed claws to hold the female firmly while mating.
                         A single female can mate with several males during the mating season and store the sperms in her body.</p>

                <div class="sadew-col">
                    <h3>Incubation behaviour</h3>
                    <p>once the eggs are laid the female turtle does not have any further contact with the nest and the eggs are left to incubate by the heat of the surrounding sand that is warmed by the sun.
                         After an incubation period of about 60 days the young turtles or ‘’hatchlings’’ begin to break out of their shells and move about in the nest.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sadew-col">
                   <h3>Hatchlings behaviour</h3>
                   <p>They immediately and rapidly crawl towards the brightest, lowest horizon, which under natural conditions is the reflection of the moon and stars on the sea. But even those hatchlings that reach the water are not out of danger.The inshore waters are home to many sharks, large fish and seabirds</p>
