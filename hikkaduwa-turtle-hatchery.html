                        <h1>Sea turtle hatchery and rescue center</h1>
                        <p> Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Centre is located a few kilometers north of the main Hikkaduwa town.
                            The hatchery and rescue center currently cares for five different species of turtles.
                             The Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle are examples of such species.
                              The sea turtle hatchery and rescue center’s facilities are cutting-edge, with water tanks to care for newborn turtles as well as adult turtle species rescued from the sea due to injuries.
                               The area where the turtles lay their eggs is one of the more unusual sights in the center, as it has distinct little mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. </p>

                        <h1>How to find sea turtles in hikkaduwa</h1>
                        <p>s soon as you walk onto the beach in Hikkaduwa, you’ll easily be able to get a sense of where the turtles are just by looking at where the tourists are congregating.
                             Make sure you head to the very left-hand side of the beach, and you’ll spot the turtles from the corner.
                             You can see the turtles right from the shore, as they come in close to graze on seaweed. 
                             They come here regularly to feed, so of course, this area is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Sri Lanka. </p>

                            <h1>How to make the most of this experience</h1>
                            <p>Finding sea turtles is one of the top things to do in hikkaduwa,but the beach here can get pretty busy!your best bet is to get to the beach as early as possible and avoid the area if its overcroweded.
                                whenever the area was crammed with tourists,we didn't get into the water because we felt it was unfair on the turtles.
                               The experience here is incredible,but only if done right!
                               The turtles come right along the shore,and you can even pick some seaward off the seafloor,
                               and hold it out.They may even swim closer to grab it off you,which is pretty exciting.
