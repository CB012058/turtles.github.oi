                             Sea turtles have mouths and jaws that are specially formed to help them eat the foods they like.
                              And each species of sea turtle eats, sleeps, mates and swims in distinctly different areas.
                               Sometimes their habitats overlap, but for the most part they each have different preferences.</p>

                        <h3>Sea turtles</h3>
                        <p>Sea turtles are large, air-breathing reptiles that inhabit tropical and subtropical seas throughout the world.
                            Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified “beaks” suited to their particular diet.
                             They do not have visible ears but have eardrums covered by skin.
                              They hear best at low frequencies, and their sense of smell is excellent. 
                              Their vision underwater is good, but they are nearsighted out of water.Sea turtles do not have teeth, but their jaws have modified “beaks” suited to their particular diet. </p>

                        <h3>Snapping turtles</h3>
                        <p> snapping turtles have a shell that covers their back, also called a carapace.
                             In snapping turtles the carapace is normally between 8 and 18 1/2 inches long.
                              The shell color ranges from dark brown to tan and can even be black.
                               As a snapping turtle grows, the shell often becomes covered with mud and algae.
                                The tail has sharp ridges running along its length, and is nearly as long as the shell.
                                 Their necks, legs, and tails have a yellowish color and the head is dark.
                                  A snapping turtle's mouth is shaped like a strong, bony beak with no teeth. Their skin is rough with characteristic bumps, called tubercles, on their necks and legs.</p>

                        <h3>Softshell Turtles</h3>
                        <p>softshell turtle is one of the largest freshwater turtle species in North America.
                             They can be distinguished from other turtle species by their carapace. 
                             Unlike most other turtles, their shell is soft, flat, and rubbery.
                              The edges of the carapace are pliable with small spine. An adult female's carapace can be anywhere from 7 to 19 inches in length.
                              while the male's is much smaller at 5 to 10 inches in length.</p>

                        <h3>Eastern turtles</h3>
                        <p>Eastern box turtles have a high, domelike carapace and a hinged plastron that allows total shell closure.
                             Their shell has a middorsal keel that smooths out with age.
                             Eastern box turtles have many uniquely identifying characteristics as part of the box turtle group.
                              While the female's plastron is flat, it is concave in males so the male may fit over the back end of the female's carapace during mating.
                               The front and back of the plastron are connected by a flexible hinge. When in danger, the turtle is able to close the plastron by pulling the hinged sections closely against the carapace, effectively sealing the soft body in bone, hence forming a "box". </p>

                        <h3>Asian box turtles</h3>
                        <p>Asian box turtles are turtles of the genus Cuora in the family Geoemydidae.
                             About 12 extant species are recognized. 
                             They range in color, usually exhibiting several shades from maroon-red, dark yellow, brown, grey, and/or black in color.
                              Some species have bright yellow stripes, alternating with black, orange, or white stripes down the length of their shells.
                               Their body color is highly variable, but usually vivid.</p>

                        <h3>Mud turtles</h3>
                        <p>little turtles look quite cute, but don't assume that they'll be docile and friendly.
                             Mud turtles are on the grouchy side and will bite with their curved beaks if they feel provoked or nervous.
                              This is one of several reasons to avoid picking up or touching a pet mud turtle unless it's absolutely necessary.
                              Some people become concerned if they smell a foul odor all of a sudden coming from their mud turtle.
                               Mud turtles are closely related to musk turtles and, like these relatives, mud turtles can secrete an awful-smelling liquid to scare off predators.</p>
