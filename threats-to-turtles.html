                        <P>In nature, sea turtles face a host of life and death obstacles to their survival.
                             Predators such as raccoons, crabs and ants raid eggs and hatchlings still in the nest.
                              Once they emerge, hatchlings make bite-sized meals for birds, crabs and a host of predators in the ocean.
                               After reaching adulthood, sea turtles are relatively immune to predation, except for the occasional shark attack.
                                These natural threats, however, are not the reasons sea turtle populations have plummeted toward extinction.
                                 To understand what really threatens sea turtle survival, we must look at the actions of humans.</p>

                        <p>Turtles get caught on long –lines, in shrimp nets and get injured with bomb fishing .
                             Turtles are similar like fishes when the people shrimp the nets they think it is a food and they  go near it and get caught.
                             A trawl is a large net that is pulled through the water column or along the seabed, catching anything that is not small enough to pass through the net’s mesh openings.
                              This fishing gear is typically used to catch fish or shrimp. Catching unwanted species is a problem for trawlers because it is a very indiscriminant form of fishing.</p>

                <p>Turtle eggs are considered to be an aphrodisiac in many places and their meat is still consumed, even though both are illegal in most countries
                    .Hawksbill sea turtles, recognized for their beautiful gold and brown shells, have been hunted for centuries to create jewelry and other luxury items.
                     As a result, these turtles are now listed as critically endangered. 
                     Scientists estimate that hawksbill populations have declined by 90 percent during the past 100 years.
                      While illegal trade is the primary cause of this decline, the demand for shells continues today on the black market.</p>

                      <p> Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean. 
                        More than 80% of this plastic comes from land.
                         It washes out from our beaches and streets.
                          It travels through storm drains into streams and rivers.
                           It flies away from landfills into our seas.
                            As a result, thousands of sea turtles accidentally swallow these plastics, mistaking them for food. 
                            Leatherbacks especially, cannot distinguish between floating jellyfish – a main component of their diet – and floating plastic bags. Most of the debris is recognizable: plastic bags, balloons, bottles, degraded buoys, plastic packaging, and food wrappers.</p>
